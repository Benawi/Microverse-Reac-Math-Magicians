## 🔑 Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

### React Project: [Requirements](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/math-magicians/sneak_peek_v2.md)

### Features Added:
- [x] Math Magicians: 
   - [x] In the [previous project](https://github.com/Benawi/Microverse-Reac-Math-Magicians/pull/1), I worked on the setup of a React application using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), now in this project:
   - [x] All the boilerplate from Create React App (text, images, styles) is deleted.
   - [x] A new directory called components was created.
   - [x] Inside components, a new Calculator.js file is created.
   - [x] In Calculator.js, create a React component that matches [this](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/math-magicians/images/calculator.png) design.
   - [x] The [design]( [this](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/math-magicians/images/calculator.png) ) only (JSX and CSS) is implemented
   - [x] Functional components used
   - [x] At least 1 child component is created
   - [x] The Calculator is imported and used in the top-level component: App.js
   - [x] All calculator buttons work according to their functionality e.g. the - button will subtract a given value
    - [x] The following external API: [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes) used to fetch data
   - [x] A [new](https://github.com/Benawi/Microverse-Reac-Math-Magicians/blob/72eb01ce2a09a5d99c719a29da5914948a1587c0/src/components/displayQuoate.js#L4) component is created for displaying a quote
   - [x] Data fetched inside of a new component
   - [x] A [loading](https://github.com/Benawi/Microverse-Reac-Math-Magicians/blob/72eb01ce2a09a5d99c719a29da5914948a1587c0/src/components/displayQuoate.js#L30-L35) state showed
   - [x] An error state stated showed [L21](https://github.com/Benawi/Microverse-Reac-Math-Magicians/blob/72eb01ce2a09a5d99c719a29da5914948a1587c0/src/components/displayQuoate.js#L21)
   - [x] The [new](https://github.com/Benawi/Microverse-Reac-Math-Magicians/blob/72eb01ce2a09a5d99c719a29da5914948a1587c0/src/components/displayQuoate.js#L4) component imported into the main component (next to the Calculator)
   - [x] A website consisting of 3 pages: Home, Calculator, and Quote is created.
   - [x] The general layout match [these](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-react-redux/blob/main/math-magicians/project_full_website_v2.md) wireframes
   - [x] styles added to improve the look and feel.
        - React basic styling (inline styles, importing CSS, and pre-processed CSS files) used.
   - [x] For every page, a <Route> created.
   - [x] Navigation links for all 3 routes are displayed on each page.
   - [x] [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) used to make the routes work.
   - [x] Set up React Testing Library.
  - [x] The official [documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) is followed
  - [x] Jest Setup(it's included in Create React App).
  - [x]  Write unit tests for the files operate.js and calculate.js using Jest.
  - [x] Create a unit for all React components tested:
    - [x] Jest snapshots used to test the components.
    - [x] React Testing Library used to simulate user interaction.
  - [x] Run full tests suite using Jest. All tests [pass](https://github.com/Benawi/Microverse-Reac-Math-Magicians/assets/21217148/09c3332f-5ec0-4ad0-9d64-481d15f7dd90)
   - [x] In the browser tested ; it render without problems, [this](https://github.com/Benawi/Microverse-Reac-Math-Magicians/assets/21217148/219b8efd-d227-4aba-b08a-1ef49d460565)

## 💻 Getting Started with Create React App <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
